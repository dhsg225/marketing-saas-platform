## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Manual Payments First
**Decision:** Scaffold Stripe but use manual payments initially  
**Reason:** Allows faster MVP launch, Stripe integration in Week 3  
**Status:** Stripe service stubbed with all methods

### 2. Multi-Step Profile Creation
**Decision:** 4-step wizard instead of single long form  
**Reason:** Better UX, less overwhelming for new talent  
**Status:** Implemented with progress indicators

### 3. Search-First Browse
**Decision:** Robust filtering on browse page  
**Reason:** Agencies need to find talent quickly by specific criteria  
**Status:** Filters for type, location, rating, price working

### 4. Portfolio as JSON
**Decision:** Store portfolio as related table vs JSONB  
**Reason:** Better queryability, easier to manage individual items  
**Status:** Separate `talent_portfolios` table
