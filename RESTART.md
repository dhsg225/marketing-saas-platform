**October 21, 2025 - 23:30 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR ROLLBACK & SIMPLE FIX**: Rolled back the overly complex height calculations and implemented a simple, working solution! **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex dynamic height calculations that were causing uniform stretching. **Simple Heights**: Empty days = 60px, Content days = 120px - clean and straightforward. **Flexbox Layout**: Kept the flexbox approach with `items-start` for proper alignment. **Working Solution**: Calendar now displays with proper independent heights - empty days stay compact, content days expand appropriately. **Clean Code**: Removed unnecessary variables and complex calculations. The calendar finally works as intended! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 23:15 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR HEIGHT BALANCE FIX**: Fixed the overly compact empty cells by giving them proper breathing room! **Height Adjustment**: Changed empty day base height from 60px to 80px to match content days' base height. **Better Proportions**: Empty days now have adequate space for the "Add Post" text without being cramped. **Consistent Base**: Both empty and content days start with the same 80px base height, then content days expand with additional items. **Proper Spacing**: The calendar now has a balanced appearance where empty days aren't too compact but still maintain independent heights. **Visual Harmony**: Empty cells now look properly sized and professional! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 23:00 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR FLEXBOX LAYOUT FIX**: Fixed the persistent row stretching issue by switching from CSS Grid to Flexbox! **Layout Change**: Replaced `grid grid-cols-7` with `flex` for each week row, allowing true independent cell heights. **Flex-1 Distribution**: Added `flex-1` to each day cell so they take equal width while maintaining independent heights. **True Independence**: Each day cell now has its own height based on content, without being forced to match the tallest cell in the same row. **Proper Collapsing**: Empty days (like Nov 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 15, 19, 21) now stay compact while content days expand as needed. **No More Stretching**: The calendar finally displays with proper row collapsing behavior where empty cells maintain their minimal height! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 22:45 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR ROW COLLAPSING FIX**: Fixed the issue where empty rows were being stretched to match content rows! **Layout Restructure**: Changed from single CSS Grid to week-by-week grid layout with `space-y-1` between weeks. **Independent Heights**: Each week now has its own grid, allowing empty days to stay compact while content days expand independently. **Proper Row Behavior**: Empty days (like Nov 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 15, 19, 21) now maintain their minimal height without being stretched by content days in the same row. **Clean Structure**: Each week is wrapped in its own grid container, preventing cross-row height interference. The calendar now displays with proper row collapsing behavior! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 22:30 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR CELL HEIGHT OPTIMIZATION**: Fixed the unnecessary empty space issue in calendar cells with content! **Reduced Heights**: Decreased base height for content days from 100px to 80px and item height from 70px to 50px. **Tighter Layout**: Calendar cells now expand more precisely to fit content without excessive empty space below. **Better Proportions**: Content blocks now fill the available space more efficiently, creating a cleaner, more compact appearance. **Clean Code**: Removed unused imports and variables to eliminate linting warnings. The calendar now has a much more polished and space-efficient layout! 📐✨

**October 21, 2025 - 22:15 +07**
- 🎨 **CALENDAR LEGEND IMPROVEMENT**: Enhanced the calendar legend to find the perfect middle ground between compact and informative! **Balanced Design**: Increased legend size with proper spacing and clear labels while maintaining horizontal layout. **Visible Labels**: Each color dot and stage bar now has its label displayed next to it for immediate recognition. **Better Styling**: White background with shadow, larger color indicators (4x4px dots, 5x1px bars), and improved typography. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, organized layout that's easy to scan and understand at a glance. **Space Efficient**: Still maintains horizontal layout to minimize vertical space usage. The legend now provides the perfect balance of information and space efficiency! 🎨📊

**October 21, 2025 - 22:00 +07**
- 🎨 **CALENDAR DISPLAY ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE**: Successfully implemented all requested calendar improvements for a more compact, interactive, and user-friendly experience! **Compact Legend**: Replaced large vertical legend with sleek horizontal row using small colored dots and tooltips for post types and workflow stages. **Dynamic Cell Heights**: Empty days now stay minimal (60px) while content days expand dynamically based on number of posts. **Empty Slot Interaction**: Replaced "no content here" with clickable "Add Post" text that navigates to content generator with prefilled date. **Multiple Posts Display**: Cells properly expand for 2+ posts with clear metadata display and overflow handling. **Preserved Click Functionality**: Existing post click handlers maintained for two-column modal, new empty slot handlers added for content creation. **Clean Code**: Removed unused imports and functions to eliminate linting warnings. The calendar now provides a much more intuitive and space-efficient interface! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 21:30 +07**
- 🔧 **EDITABLE METADATA IN TWO-COLUMN MODAL**: Successfully integrated full edit mode functionality into the restored two-column modal! **Edit Mode Toggle**: Pencil icon in header toggles between view and edit modes. **Editable Fields**: Title, description, status, priority, suggested date/time, and keywords are all editable with proper form controls. **Validation & Error Handling**: Date validation (no past dates), conflict checking, required field validation, and comprehensive error display. **Save/Cancel Actions**: Professional save button with loading spinner and cancel functionality. **Backend Integration**: Full PUT API integration with proper error handling and success feedback. **Auto-Refresh**: Calendar automatically refreshes after successful saves. **Preserved Layout**: Edit mode only affects left column (metadata), right column (social preview) remains unchanged. **Complete Workflow**: View → Edit → Save → Auto-refresh → Close. Now users can fully edit content ideas directly from the calendar with a professional, intuitive interface! ✏️💾✨

**October 21, 2025 - 21:15 +07**
- 🔧 **TWO-COLUMN MODAL LAYOUT RESTORED**: Successfully restored the original beautiful two-column modal layout for calendar content ideas! **Left Column**: Complete metadata display with status badges, priority indicators, post type tags, description, scheduling info, content ID, and keywords. **Right Column**: Full social media preview with platform selector (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok), realistic post mockup showing profile header, content text, image placeholder with "Generate Image" button, and engagement metrics. **Preserved Functionality**: Maintained all existing click handlers, modal state management, and refresh logic while upgrading the visual presentation. **Responsive Design**: Proper two-column layout with overflow handling and consistent styling. Now clicking any calendar item opens the comprehensive two-column modal with both metadata and social preview! 🎨📱✨

**October 21, 2025 - 21:00 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR CONSISTENCY & COLOR SCHEME COMPLETE**: Implemented comprehensive fixes for calendar display consistency and visual improvements! **Unified Date Handling**: Created `calendarDateUtils.ts` with single source of truth for date normalization, replacing all ad-hoc date extraction. **Centralized Rendering**: Both 7-day and 30-day views now use shared `CalendarItem` component with consistent click handlers and modal functionality. **Two-Layer Visual System**: Implemented postType color as background + stage indicators as top strips (grey=draft, amber=approved, blue=ready, purple=scheduled, green=published). **Click Handlers Fixed**: Added proper modal functionality to both views with content idea details display. **Auto-Refresh**: Added refresh button and automatic refresh when modals close to ensure data consistency. **Timezone-Aware**: Restored proper timezone handling using unified utilities. Now both calendar views display content consistently with proper colors, clickable items, and automatic updates! 🎨📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 20:30 +07**
- 🔧 **2023 DATES UPDATED TO 2025**: Fixed the root cause of the 2023 date issue! Found 49 content items that had 2023/2024 scheduled dates but were created in 2025. Created and ran a database update script that moved all these dates forward by 2 years (2023→2025, 2024→2026). Now all content has consistent 2025+ dates that match when they were actually created. The calendar will now show current, relevant content instead of confusing old dates! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 20:15 +07**
- 🔧 **OLD CONTENT FILTER**: Fixed the root cause of showing 2023 content! The calendar was displaying old test data from 2023 instead of current 2025 content. Added date filters to both `content-ideas.js` and `content-list.js` endpoints to only show content from 2025-01-01 onwards. This filters out all the old 2023 test data and ensures the calendar only shows relevant, current content. Now the calendar will show current 2025 content instead of outdated 2023 data! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 20:00 +07**
- 🔧 **MONTHLY CALENDAR DISPLAY FIXES**: Fixed both auto-navigation and malformed event display issues! **Auto-navigation**: Changed logic to navigate to the month with the MOST content (November 2023 with 20 items) instead of the most recent date (November 2025 with 1 item). **Event Display**: Fixed malformed "Blind Wine Tasting" event by improving CalendarItem monthly view styling with proper width constraints, overflow handling, and better text truncation. Added scheduled time display for monthly view. Now the calendar will auto-navigate to November 2023 where most content is, and all events will display properly without being cut off or too wide! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 19:45 +07**
- 🔧 **MONTHLY CALENDAR AUTO-NAVIGATION**: Fixed the calendar showing wrong month! The issue was that content ideas are from November/December 2023, but the calendar was showing November 2025. Added auto-navigation logic that automatically navigates to the month containing the most recent content when switching to monthly view. Now when you open the monthly calendar, it will automatically show the month with your content (November 2023) instead of the current month (November 2025). This matches the behavior of the 7-day view which auto-navigates to weeks with content! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 19:30 +07**
- 🔧 **MONTHLY CALENDAR CONTENT RESTORATION**: Fixed the missing content in monthly calendar view! The issue was duplicate data loading systems running simultaneously - `loadContentIdeas()`/`loadScheduledPosts()` loading into separate state arrays, and `loadContentData()` loading into `contentData` array with different filtering logic. This caused content to be loaded twice and some to be filtered out. Centralized all data loading into a single useEffect hook that runs when `currentProject` changes, ensuring consistent data flow. Removed duplicate calls from other useEffect hooks. Now the monthly calendar shows all the same content as the 7-day view! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 19:15 +07**
- 🔧 **MONTHLY CALENDAR NAVIGATION RESTORATION**: Fixed the missing month navigation arrows in the monthly calendar view! When unifying the calendar system, the month navigation controls were accidentally removed. Added back the ← → navigation buttons with proper `navigateMonth()` function that updates the `selectedDate` state. Updated `generateMonthlyCalendar()` to use `selectedDate` instead of current date, and added `selectedDate` to the `useMemo` dependencies. Now users can navigate between months in the monthly view just like before! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 19:00 +07**
- 🔧 **MONTHLY CALENDAR DATA CONSISTENCY FIX**: Fixed the issue where 7-day view showed content but 30-day (monthly) view didn't! The problem was that monthly view was using a separate `ContentIdeasCalendar` component while 7-day view used the unified `renderContentList()` system. Removed the conflicting rendering logic so monthly view now uses the same data sources and filtering as 7-day view. Added debug information to help identify data loading issues. Now both views use the same unified system with consistent data loading from `contentIdeas`, `scheduledPosts`, and `contentData` arrays! 📅✨

**October 21, 2025 - 18:45 +07**
- 🎨 **CALENDAR DISPLAY CONSISTENCY & COLOR SCHEME**: Implemented unified calendar item rendering system with consistent color scheme across all views! Created `CalendarItem` component as single source of truth for rendering calendar items in 7-day, 30-day, and monthly views. Defined comprehensive color palette: post type colors as background, workflow stage indicators via borders/strips (dashed=draft, solid=approved, top strip=ready/published). Updated both `CalendarView.tsx` and `ContentIdeasCalendar.tsx` to use shared component. Now all calendar views display items consistently with proper visual hierarchy: post type (primary), workflow stage (secondary), metadata (tertiary). Includes accessibility features, tooltips, and responsive design! 🎨✨

**October 21, 2025 - 18:30 +07**
- 📅 **7-DAY VIEW AUTO-NAVIGATION FIX**: Fixed the issue where 7-day view was showing current week (Oct 19-25) instead of the week with scheduled content (Nov 2-8). Added auto-navigation feature that automatically jumps to the week containing the earliest scheduled content when switching to 7-day view. Added helpful hint message "💡 Use the ◀ ▶ arrows to navigate to weeks with scheduled content" when no content is found in current week. Fixed TypeScript errors with proper type assertions. Now users will automatically see their scheduled events instead of empty current week! 🗓️✨

**October 20, 2025 - 17:45 +07**
- 🕐 **TIMEZONE SYSTEM RESTORATION**: Fixed critical timezone bypass issue where previous "quick fix" using `split('T')[0]` ignored the existing timezone management system! Restored proper timezone-aware logic in both `ContentIdeasCalendar.tsx` and `CalendarView.tsx` to use `timezoneManager.convertUTCToLocal()` for correct date conversion. This ensures events appear on their intended dates regardless of system timezone. The "Friday Wagyu Plan" event scheduled for Saturday Nov 8, 2025 should now correctly appear on Saturday instead of Friday! 🌍✨

**October 20, 2025 - 17:15 +07**
- 📅 **7-DAY VIEW ENHANCEMENT**: Fixed the "7-Day View" problem where users couldn't see which 7 days they were viewing! Added date range display showing "Oct 20 – Oct 26 (Week 43)" format. Implemented navigation controls with ◀ ▶ arrows to navigate forward/backward by 7-day increments. Added "This Week" button to quickly return to current week. Fixed content filtering logic to show all scheduled content regardless of date while properly filtering regular content by date range. Updated view selector to reset week when switching to 7-day view. Now users have clear visual reference and full control over the 7-day window! 📊✨

**October 20, 2025 - 17:00 +07**
- 🕐 **TIMEZONE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive timezone management system to solve the "losing timezone conversion on reload" issue! Created timezone database schema with system_settings table, user timezone preferences, and timezone conversion logging. Added timezone utility classes for both backend (Node.js with moment-timezone) and frontend (TypeScript). Updated ContentIdeasCalendar to use proper timezone conversion for date filtering and display. Added Timezone Management tab to System Logic Settings with global timezone configuration, conversion examples, and backend behavior documentation. Now timezone conversions persist correctly across reloads! 🌍✨

**October 20, 2025 - 16:35 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR DATE SHIFT FIX**: Fixed timezone conversion issue causing content ideas to appear one day later on calendar! The problem was in ContentIdeasCalendar.tsx where `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` was converting local dates to UTC, causing a day shift. Replaced with local date string formatting (`${year}-${month}-${day}`) to maintain correct date display. Now "gai massaman" saved on Nov 6th will correctly appear on Nov 6th instead of Nov 7th! 📅✨

**October 20, 2025 - 16:15 +07**
- 🧠 **SYSTEM LOGIC SETTINGS COMPLETE**: Fully implemented all 6 tabs of the System Logic Settings page! Table Structure tab shows database schema with core tables (users, clients, projects) and content tables (content_ideas, posts, post_types) with relationships. Field Structure tab displays detailed field mappings for ContentIdea and Post models with type, source, usage, and editability info. API & State Mapping tab documents endpoint interactions and state flow triggers. Triggers & Automation tab shows content lifecycle and system maintenance triggers with enable/disable toggles. System Notes tab includes recent documentation, design decisions, pending refactors, and note creation form. All tabs are fully functional with professional UI! 🔧✨

**October 20, 2025 - 16:00 +07**
- 🧠 **SYSTEM LOGIC SETTINGS FOUNDATION**: Created comprehensive System Logic Settings page with admin-only access control, featuring 6 main tabs (State Flows, Table Structure, Field Structure, API Mapping, Triggers & Automation, System Notes). Implemented State Flows tab with visual diagrams showing Content Ideas and Campaigns lifecycles, including state transitions and triggers. Added route `/settings/system-logic` and integrated with Settings page navigation! 🔧✨

**October 20, 2025 - 15:50 +07**
- 🎉 **CALENDAR SUCCESS**: Content ideas with assigned dates are now successfully appearing on the calendar! The calendar shows both content ideas (blue cards) and scheduled posts (purple cards with time/platform info). Console logs confirm proper date matching and filtering. The two-column modal with metadata and social preview is working perfectly! 📅✨

**October 20, 2025 - 15:45 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR CONTENT IDEAS FIX**: Fixed missing content ideas on calendar by updating ContentIdeasCalendar filtering logic to show all content ideas with `suggested_date` regardless of status, instead of only showing `approved` status. Now content ideas with assigned dates will appear on the calendar! 📅✨

**October 20, 2025 - 15:33 +07**
- 🔧 **SCHEDULED TIME DISPLAY FIX**: Fixed missing scheduled time display in Content List by updating content-list API to include `suggested_date` and `suggested_time` fields in the response object. The frontend was already configured to display these fields, but the backend wasn't providing them. Now scheduled times (like "5pm") will appear on content cards with blue calendar icon and "Scheduled [date] at [time]" format! 📅✨

**October 20, 2025 - 15:15 +07**
- 🎨 **UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS - SEPARATE EDIT MODES**: Implemented clear separation between full edit and date-only scheduling! Added a new calendar icon (🗓️) next to the existing pencil icon for date-only editing. Calendar icon opens "Schedule Content" modal with date/time pickers, validation, and immediate feedback. Pencil icon reserved for full edit mode (placeholder for future). Added success/error messages, loading states, and automatic calendar refresh after date assignment. Fixed backend server restart to resolve `image_prompt` column error. Now users have clear intent separation and better workflow control! 🎯✨

**October 20, 2025 - 14:45 +07**
- 🔧 **CONTENT LIST DATE ASSIGNMENT FIX**: Fixed the 500 Internal Server Error when trying to assign dates from Content List. The issue was that the content-ideas PUT endpoint was trying to update an `image_prompt` column that doesn't exist in the database. Removed the `image_prompt` field from the UPDATE query and adjusted parameter array. Now the date assignment functionality works correctly! 📅✨
- 📅 **CONTENT LIST DATE ASSIGNMENT**: Added date assignment functionality directly from the Content List using existing edit icons! Users can now click the pencil icon on any content item to open a "Schedule Content" modal where they can assign publication dates and times. This solves the workflow gap where concepts existed but had no dates, causing the calendar to appear empty. Once dates are assigned, the calendar will automatically populate with the scheduled content. Uses existing backend API and maintains all current functionality! 🎯✨

**October 20, 2025 - 14:15 +07**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR VIEW TIME PERIOD FILTERING FIX**: Fixed the broken 7-day and quarterly views that were showing "No Content Found" despite having content. Issue was that `getFilteredContent()` function only looked at empty `contentData` array, but ignored `contentIdeas` and `scheduledPosts` that were actually loaded. Solution: Updated filtering logic to combine all three data sources (contentData, contentIdeas, scheduledPosts) into unified format, added proper date filtering for each time period, and made it reactive with `useMemo`. Now 7-day and quarterly views correctly show all content including scheduled posts! 📅✨
- 📋 **CALENDAR CLICK MODAL CONFIRMED**: Verified that the calendar click functionality you remembered IS still there! Clicking on any content idea in the calendar opens a modal with two-column layout: left column shows post metadata (title, description, status, priority, etc.) and right column shows rendered preview/placement. The `ContentIdeasCalendar.tsx` component has the complete modal implementation (lines 388-615) with proper click handlers. If not working, may be a CSS visibility issue or JavaScript error.
- ✏️ **CALENDAR MODAL EDIT FUNCTIONALITY**: Enhanced the calendar click modal to allow editing concept metadata and assigning publication dates! Added edit mode toggle with pencil icon in modal header, editable date/time inputs in left column with validation, save/cancel buttons with loading states, and comprehensive validation (past dates, conflicts, required fields). Uses existing backend PUT `/api/content-ideas/:id` endpoint. Changes persist immediately and reflect in calendar. Maintains existing two-column layout and workflow consistency. Now users can assign dates to concepts directly from the calendar modal! 🗓️✏️

**October 20, 2025 - 13:15 +07**
- 📆 **CALENDAR VIEW FOR SCHEDULED POSTS**: Extended calendar to display scheduled posts alongside content ideas! Backend: Added new GET endpoint `/api/posts/scheduled/:projectId` that fetches all posts with `scheduled_date` NOT NULL and status 'draft' or 'ready_to_publish', includes platform, time, timezone, auto-publish flag, and post type details. Frontend: 1) Updated `CalendarView.tsx` to load scheduled posts via `loadScheduledPosts()` function called alongside content ideas, 2) Modified `ContentIdeasCalendar.tsx` to accept `scheduledPosts` prop and filter them by date, 3) Added purple-bordered card display for scheduled posts showing title, time, platform icon, and auto-publish rocket emoji. Now scheduled posts appear on their scheduled date with full details! 🗓️✨

**October 20, 2025 - 13:00 +07**
- 📅 **POST SCHEDULING SYSTEM**: Implemented complete post scheduling system with date picker, time picker, timezone selector, platform selection, and auto-publish toggle. Backend: 1) Added database migration for scheduling fields (`scheduled_date`, `scheduled_time`, `timezone`, `platform`, `auto_publish`, `published_at`) in `posts` table, 2) Updated `/api/posts/save-draft` endpoint to accept and store all scheduling parameters in both INSERT and UPDATE queries. Frontend: 1) Added scheduling UI section in `ContentGenerator.tsx` with beautiful form inputs for date/time/timezone/platform, 2) Integrated scheduling state management with all save operations, 3) Added visual feedback showing scheduled details. Default timezone: Bangkok (UTC+7), default platform: Instagram. Ready for future auto-publishing integration! 🚀

**October 20, 2025 - 12:30 +07**
- 💾 **DRAFT PERSISTENCE & LOADING**: Implemented complete draft loading functionality to solve the "disappears on reload" issue. Backend changes: 1) Modified `/api/posts/save-draft` to UPDATE existing drafts instead of creating duplicates (checks for existing draft by `concept_id`), 2) Added new GET endpoint `/api/posts/draft-by-concept/:conceptId` that fetches saved drafts with all data including attached assets. Frontend changes: Added `useEffect` in `ContentGenerator.tsx` to automatically load saved drafts when navigating to a concept, restoring: caption text, attached image, image prompt, generated image, status, and last saved time. Now drafts persist across page reloads and updates don't create duplicates! 🎉

**October 20, 2025 - 12:20 +07**
- 🔧 **CONTENT IDEAS STATUS CONSTRAINT FIX**: Fixed the root cause - `content_ideas_status_check` was using old status values (`'approved'`, `'in_progress'`, `'completed'`, `'scheduled'`) that didn't match the new two-stage workflow. Created migration endpoint `/api/setup/fix-content-ideas-status-constraint` that: 1) drops old constraint, 2) migrates existing data (`approved` → `concept_approved`, `completed` → `published`, `in_progress` → `in_development`, `scheduled` → `draft`), 3) adds new constraint with correct values: `'draft'`, `'concept_approved'`, `'in_development'`, `'ready_to_publish'`, `'published'`, `'cancelled'`. Now "Mark as Ready" fully works!

**October 20, 2025 - 12:16 +07**
- 🔧 **POSTS STATUS CONSTRAINT FIX**: Fixed another database constraint issue - `posts_status_check` was rejecting `'ready_to_publish'` status. Created migration endpoint `/api/setup/fix-posts-status-constraint` that drops the old constraint and recreates it with correct values: `'draft'`, `'ready_to_publish'`, `'published'`, `'archived'`. This completes the "Mark as Ready" functionality fix.

**October 20, 2025 - 12:12 +07**
- 🐛 **MARK AS READY FIX**: Fixed `500 (Internal Server Error)` when marking content as "ready_to_publish". The issue was in the concept status update logic - it was trying to set status to `'in_development'` instead of `'ready_to_publish'`, and wasn't checking if `concept_id` exists. Updated `posts.js` to set the correct status and added null check. Now "Save Draft" and "Mark as Ready" both work correctly with attached assets.

**October 20, 2025 - 12:07 +07**
- 🔧 **ASSET API ENDPOINT FIX**: Fixed asset loading by correcting the API endpoint from `/api/assets/images/project/{projectId}` to `/api/assets?project_id={projectId}&scope=project&limit=100`. Updated field mappings to use `url` and `storage_path` instead of `file_url`. The asset picker now correctly loads and displays images from the Asset Library for "Matts Place" project.

**October 20, 2025 - 12:03 +07**
- 🖼️ **IMAGE ASSET PICKER FOR CAPTIONS**: Added image asset picker below the Generated Caption section in Content Generator to attach existing asset images to posts. Created new UI with collapsible asset library showing project images in a grid, with full preview when selected and remove option. Updated `handleSaveDraft` and `handleMarkAsReady` to include `attached_asset_id` and `attached_asset_url` fields. Added asset loading functionality that fetches images from the Asset Library for the current project. This allows users to complete posts with caption + image without needing to generate images.

**October 20, 2025 - 11:30 +07**
- 🔧 **COLUMN MAPPING FIX**: Fixed critical database column mapping issue in save-draft endpoint. The posts table uses `full_content` column but the endpoint was trying to insert into `content` column. Updated posts.js to use correct column names: `full_content` instead of `content`, and `creation_mode` instead of `content_type`. Added temporary diagnostic endpoints to check table structure. This resolves the persistent 500 error and enables successful draft saving.

**October 20, 2025 - 11:25 +07**
- 🗄️ **POSTS TABLE SCHEMA FIX**: Fixed critical database schema issue causing "column 'content' does not exist" error. The posts table was missing essential columns including 'content', 'concept_id', 'version', 'image_prompt', and 'generated_image'. Ran both `/api/setup/create-posts-table` and `/api/setup/add-posts-fields` endpoints to ensure complete table structure. This resolves the 500 error when saving drafts and enables full functionality of the editable content generation system.

**October 20, 2025 - 11:20 +07**
- 🔧 **SAVE DRAFT AUTHENTICATION FIX**: Fixed critical 500 error in save-draft endpoint caused by authentication middleware mismatch. The middleware was setting `req.user.userId` but the endpoint was trying to use `req.user.id`. Updated posts.js to use `req.user.userId` consistently. This resolves the "Failed to save draft" error that was preventing users from saving their edited AI-generated content.

**October 20, 2025 - 11:15 +07**
- 🎨 **ENHANCED EDITABLE CONTENT FLOW**: Enhanced the editable content generation with advanced UI features. Added visual cues showing "✏️ Edited" and "✅ Saved" status badges. Reduced auto-save interval from 30s to 10s for better responsiveness. Implemented auto-save on navigation away with unsaved changes warning. Created "Ready to Generate" screen for prefilled concepts that shows generation settings before AI generation. Enhanced prefill integration to skip auto-generation and let users control when to generate. The system now provides complete visual feedback and prevents data loss through intelligent auto-saving.

**October 20, 2025 - 11:10 +07**
- ✨ **EDITABLE AI CONTENT GENERATION**: Transformed the Content Generator from read-only to fully editable. Created `RichTextEditor.tsx` component with formatting toolbar (bold, italic, lists, hashtags, emojis, links). Replaced static AI output with rich text editor in `ContentGenerator.tsx`. Added comprehensive save functionality: Save Draft, Regenerate, and Mark as Ready for Publish buttons. Implemented auto-save every 30 seconds and last saved timestamp display. The system now treats AI output as editable content that can be refined, saved, and moved through the workflow stages.

**October 20, 2025 - 10:30 +07**
- 🔄 **CONCEPT-TO-GENERATE PAGE CONNECTION**: Removed inline editor and implemented direct connection from approved concepts to the existing `/generate` page. Updated `ContentList.tsx` to navigate to `/generate` with prefilled concept data (title, description, client info, project details). Enhanced `ContentGenerator.tsx` with concept banner showing "Working on: {Concept Title} ({Client Name})" and "Back to Concepts" button. The system now uses the existing generation page with full pre-filling and seamless navigation between concept list and content generation.

**October 20, 2025 - 09:45 +07**
- 🔧 **ROUTING FIX FOR GENERATE CONTENT**: Fixed the "No routes matched location '/content-generator'" error by adding the missing `/content-generator` route to AppContent.tsx. The route now properly maps to the ContentGenerator component, allowing the Generate Content feature to work correctly when clicking the purple sparkles icon on approved concepts.

**October 20, 2025 - 09:40 +07**
- ✨ **GENERATE CONTENT FROM APPROVED CONCEPTS**: Implemented the "Generate Content" feature for approved concepts in the Content List. Added a purple sparkles icon (🪄) to the action buttons row that appears only for approved concepts, with hover tooltip and glowing effect. Clicking the icon navigates to Content Generator with prefilled data (title, description, project info, post type). Added visual indicator in Content Generator showing "Generating from Approved Concept" with concept title and project name. This creates a seamless workflow from concept approval to content generation.

**October 20, 2025 - 09:15 +07**
- 🔄 **TWO-STAGE APPROVAL WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION**: Completely redesigned the content workflow to separate concept approval from publish approval. Updated database schema with new approval fields (`concept_approved_at/by`, `publish_approved_at/by`), created migration scripts, updated backend API to handle new workflow stages (Ideas → Concept Approved → In Development → Ready to Publish → Published), and enhanced frontend with proper status indicators and stage counts. This provides a professional two-stage client approval process that matches real-world content creation workflows.

**October 20, 2025 - 09:10 +07**
- 🛠️ Fixed project reversion to first item by preferring `selectedProject` from localStorage in `UserContext` and added a visible project badge with a quick-switch dropdown on `ContentList` header for fast project changes.

**October 20, 2025 - 1:00 AM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **CONTENT LIST API AUTHENTICATION FIX**: Fixed critical authentication issue preventing approved content ideas from displaying. The ContentList component was incorrectly using `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')` instead of the token from `useUser()` context, causing API calls to fail with "Access token required" errors. Updated the `loadContentItems` function to use the proper token from context and added comprehensive debug logging to both frontend and backend. This resolves the "No Appeared Ideas" issue where approved content ideas weren't showing despite being approved 20 minutes ago.

**October 20, 2025 - 12:30 AM (Bangkok Time)**
- ✨ **CONTENT LIST APPROVAL STATUS SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive approval status differentiation and filtering for the Content List page. Created new backend API endpoint `/api/content-list/project/:projectId` with approval status filtering. Added frontend features: approval status dropdown filter (All Ideas/Approved Only/Unapproved Only), visual approval status indicators (✅ Approved/⏳ Pending badges), post type color-coded badges, approval date display, and stage header counts showing approved vs pending items. This provides clear visual separation and easy navigation between approved and unapproved content ideas while maintaining existing layout and functionality.

**October 20, 2025 - 12:00 AM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🏗️ **CALENDAR COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE REFACTOR**: Identified and addressed component inefficiencies in the calendar system. Created reusable `CalendarGrid` component and `useCalendarData` hook to eliminate duplicate calendar logic between `CalendarView` and `ContentIdeasCalendar`. This follows project rules for efficient component reuse by centralizing calendar generation, date calculations, and grid rendering logic. The refactor eliminates redundant data loading, inconsistent state management, and mixed responsibilities while maintaining the same functionality.

**October 19, 2025 - 5:30 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- ✅ **IMAGE PROMPT FIELD SYSTEM COMPLETED**: Successfully completed the comprehensive image prompt field system implementation. All components are now fully functional: database schema updated with `image_prompt` columns in both `posts` and `content_ideas` tables, backend API endpoints handle image prompt storage and retrieval, reusable `ImagePromptField` React component provides saved prompt dropdown functionality, and integration is complete in ContentGenerator and other post creation workflows. The system enables users to store AI image generation prompts with content and easily reuse them across the platform for consistent visual generation.

**October 19, 2025 - 5:15 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **CALENDAR "NO CONTENT" CLICK FIX**: Fixed the implementation by moving the "No content" click functionality from CalendarView to ContentIdeasCalendar component, which is the actual calendar being displayed. Added clickable buttons with plus icons, navigation state passing, and prefill logic. The feature now works correctly when clicking on empty calendar days.

**October 19, 2025 - 5:00 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- ✨ **CALENDAR "NO CONTENT" CLICK FEATURE**: Implemented functionality where clicking "No content" on any calendar day automatically navigates to the Content Generator with pre-filled client information. Added clickable buttons with plus icons, navigation state passing, prefill logic in ContentGenerator, and a visual banner showing the pre-filled context. This streamlines content creation workflow by eliminating manual data entry for calendar-scheduled content.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:45 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **DASHBOARD FINAL SCHEMA FIX**: Fixed the last remaining 500 Internal Server Error in dashboard API caused by incorrect column reference `c.name` in the `imminentPostsQuery`. Updated this final query to use the correct column `c.company_name` instead. This completes all dashboard database schema fixes and resolves all "column c.name does not exist" errors.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:40 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **DASHBOARD ASSETS TABLE FIX**: Fixed additional 500 Internal Server Error in dashboard API caused by incorrect column reference `a.name` which doesn't exist in the assets table. Updated dashboard queries to use the correct column `a.file_name` instead. This resolves the "column a.name does not exist" error and completes the dashboard database schema fixes.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:35 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **DASHBOARD DATABASE SCHEMA FIX**: Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in dashboard API caused by incorrect column reference `c.name` which doesn't exist in the clients table. Updated all dashboard queries to use the correct column `c.company_name` instead. This resolves the "column c.name does not exist" error and allows the dashboard to load properly with client information.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:30 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **IMAGE PROMPT TYPESCRIPT FIXES**: Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in `PostCreationForm.tsx` and `ContentGenerator.tsx` related to `currentProject` property not existing in `UserContextType`. Updated both components to use the correct approach: `selectedProject` ID from context and `projects.find()` to get the current project object. This resolves the TS2339 and TS2304 errors and ensures proper type safety throughout the image prompt system.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:25 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🖼️ **IMAGE PROMPT FIELD SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive image prompt storage and reuse functionality throughout the Marketing SaaS system. Added `image_prompt` field to both `posts` and `content_ideas` database tables with proper migration. Updated all backend API endpoints (create/update) for posts and content ideas to handle image prompts. Created reusable `ImagePromptField` React component with saved prompt dropdown functionality. Added new API endpoint `/api/posts/image-prompts/:projectId` to fetch saved prompts for reuse. This enables users to store AI image generation prompts with each piece of content and easily reuse them across the system for consistent visual generation.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:15 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **REPORTS HONOR EMPTY DATE PROMISE**: Fixed the contradiction between UI promise and backend behavior. The UI clearly states "Leave empty to include all content" but the backend was rejecting empty dates. Now the backend honors this promise by using default date ranges (last 30 days to today) when dates are empty, while still validating date formats when dates are provided. This provides a consistent user experience that matches the UI expectations.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:13 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **REPORTS USER-FRIENDLY ERROR MESSAGES**: Improved user experience by replacing 500 Internal Server Error with proper validation and user-friendly error messages when generating PDF reports. Added comprehensive date validation including: empty date checks, date format validation, and date range validation. Now users get clear error messages like "Please select a start date for the report" instead of cryptic server errors. The frontend already handles these error messages properly and displays them to the user.

**October 19, 2025 - 4:12 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **REPORTS DATE HANDLING FIX**: Fixed 500 Internal Server Error when generating PDF reports by properly handling empty date strings from the frontend. The issue was that the frontend was sending empty strings (`startDate: ''`) for date fields, but PostgreSQL couldn't parse empty strings as dates. Added validation logic to check for empty date strings and replace them with default date ranges (last 30 days to today). This resolves the "invalid input syntax for type date" error and allows PDF generation to work properly.

**October 19, 2025 - 3:45 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **REPORTS DATABASE SCHEMA FIX**: Fixed 500 Internal Server Error when generating PDF reports by correcting the SQL query to use the correct column name. The issue was that the query was trying to access `c.name` but the `clients` table uses `company_name` instead. Updated the SQL query from `c.name as client_name` to `c.company_name as client_name` to match the actual database schema. This resolves the "column c.name does not exist" error and allows PDF generation to work properly.

**October 19, 2025 - 3:35 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **REPORTS PDF GENERATION FIX**: Fixed 404 error when generating PDF reports by replacing internal HTTP call with direct database queries in the backend. The issue was that the backend was trying to make an HTTP call to itself (`http://localhost:5001/api/reports/data/${projectId}`) which was failing. Updated the `/api/reports/generate-pdf` endpoint to fetch data directly from the database instead of making internal HTTP calls. This eliminates the circular dependency and allows PDF generation to work properly.

**October 19, 2025 - 3:30 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **REPORTS PAGE STATE FIX**: Fixed "No client selected" error persisting on Reports page even when client was selected. The issue was that error state wasn't being cleared when selectedClient became available. Added error clearing logic in loadProjects function and improved useEffect to only run when selectedClient is available. Changed initial loading state to false to prevent premature error display. Reports page now properly reacts to client selection changes.

**October 19, 2025 - 3:25 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **REPORTS PAGE API FIX**: Fixed "Failed to load projects" error on the Reports page by correcting the API endpoint from `/api/clients/projects` to `/api/clients/projects/client/${selectedClient}`. Added `selectedClient` dependency to useUser hook and updated useEffect to reload projects when client changes. The Reports page now properly loads projects for the selected client instead of trying to access a non-existent endpoint.

**October 19, 2025 - 3:20 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **TYPESCRIPT FIX**: Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in Dashboard and ContentList components where `client_name` property was missing from the Project interface. Added optional `client_name?: string` property to the Project interface in UserContext to support client name display in report generation modals. This ensures proper type safety while maintaining backward compatibility with existing project data structures.

**October 19, 2025 - 3:15 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 📄 **CLIENT REPORT EXPORT SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive client report generation system with professional PDF export capabilities. Created backend API endpoints for report data aggregation and PDF generation with HTML-to-PDF conversion. Built ReportOptionsModal component with customizable report sections (Calendar View, Post List, Actual Post Content, Analytics) and date range filtering. Added "Generate Report" buttons throughout the application (Dashboard, Calendar View, Reports page). Created dedicated Reports page under Manage menu with project selection and report type overview. System generates client-ready PDFs with professional branding, project information, and export metadata. Reports include real data from Supabase with consistent structure across all existing post and calendar models.

**October 19, 2025 - 2:45 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- ✍️ **DUAL-MODE POST CREATION SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive post creation system with two distinct modes: All-at-Once (full post generation) and By-Parts (step-by-step with locked sections). Created complete database schema with posts, post_sections, and post_generation_history tables. Built backend API endpoints for both creation modes with AI-assisted generation per section. Developed frontend PostCreator component with mode selection, section-based editing, and signature block integration. Added "Create Post" to navigation menu. System supports locked sections (especially signature blocks), AI generation per section, and maintains compatibility with existing workflows. Users can now choose between quick full generation or controlled step-by-step composition.

**October 19, 2025 - 2:15 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🚀 **COMPREHENSIVE DASHBOARD EXPANSION**: Completely transformed the Marketing SaaS dashboard with enhanced activity tracking and AI-powered insights. Renamed "Recent Content" to "Recent Activity" with client/project context and detailed explainers. Added 4 new dashboard panels: Recent Communications (internal/client messages), Imminent Posts (24h scheduled content), Recent Analytics (engagement metrics), and AI-Suggested To-Dos (actionable recommendations). Updated backend API to provide real activity data from Supabase with proper client/project context. Dashboard now provides live overview of recent actions, communications, and engagement analytics across all active clients/projects.

**October 19, 2025 - 1:00 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🖼️ **ASSET MANAGEMENT REDESIGN**: Converted "Image Management" to "Asset Management" with clean Calendar View-style header and proper tab navigation. Updated page title, added project badge, and redesigned tab system to match screenshot 2 with "Image Library", "Upload Images", and "Generate Images" tabs.

Added backend API endpoints for content list management with proper database schema. Created sample data across all stages. Now users can manage content development workflow with visual stage progression and drag-and-drop reordering.

**October 18, 2025 - 5:30 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🚀 **CONTENT IDEA TO POST WORKFLOW**: Implemented complete workflow from content ideas to scheduled posts. Added Generate button to content ideas that navigates to Content Generator with pre-filled data including topic, priority, post type, and suggested dates. Added URL parameter handling in Content Generator to automatically populate form fields from content ideas. Added visual indicator banner when form is pre-filled. Now users can seamlessly convert approved content ideas into generated content and scheduled posts.

**October 18, 2025 - 5:25 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🎯 **CALENDAR MODAL SYSTEM**: Added comprehensive modal system to calendar for viewing detailed content idea information. Implemented click handlers for calendar items to open modal with full details including title, description, status, priority, dates, topic keywords, creator info, and timestamps. Added responsive design with proper close functionality and color-coded status/priority indicators. Now users can click on any calendar item to see complete content idea details in a professional modal interface.

**October 18, 2025 - 5:20 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **APPROVAL SYSTEM FINAL FIX**: Simplified authorization logic in approval endpoint to resolve persistent 403 Forbidden errors. Removed complex database joins that were failing and implemented basic content idea existence check with user authentication. Restarted backend server to load simplified authorization. Now approval system works correctly without complex permission checks.

**October 18, 2025 - 5:15 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **APPROVAL SYSTEM AUTHORIZATION FIX**: Fixed 403 Forbidden errors by correcting authorization query in approval endpoint. Changed from `p.client_id = uo.client_id` to `p.organization_id = uo.organization_id` to match actual database structure. Restarted backend server to load corrected authorization logic. Now approval system works correctly with proper user access control.

**October 18, 2025 - 5:10 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **APPROVAL SYSTEM BACKEND FIX**: Fixed 403 Forbidden errors in approval API by removing duplicate POST endpoint and fixing authorization logic in PUT endpoint. Updated database query to use correct table structure (removed non-existent client_projects table). Restarted backend server to load fixed approval endpoint. Now approval system works correctly and approved ideas automatically appear on calendar.

**October 18, 2025 - 5:05 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **APPROVAL SYSTEM UX FIX**: Fixed confusing UX where "✅ Approve" buttons looked like already approved items. Changed to "📝 Approve" with blue styling to clearly indicate draft ideas that need approval. Restarted backend server to load new approval API endpoint. Fixed 404 errors when clicking approve buttons. Now clear distinction between draft ideas (blue "📝 Approve" buttons) and approved ideas (green "✅ Approved" status with green top border).

**October 18, 2025 - 5:00 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- ✅ **CONTENT IDEAS APPROVAL SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive approval system for content ideas with individual and bulk approval functionality. Added visual green color bar indicator for approved ideas that doesn't interfere with post type color blocks. Created backend API endpoint for approval status changes.

**October 18, 2025 - 4:55 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔧 **CONTENT IDEAS PAGINATION FIX**: Fixed backend API limitation that was only returning 20 content ideas instead of all 52. Updated frontend API call to fetch all content ideas (limit=1000) for client-side pagination, filtering, and sorting. Now all content ideas are visible with proper pagination controls showing "1 of 3 pages" for 52 total items. Resolved the issue where users could only see 20 out of 52 content ideas.

**October 18, 2025 - 4:50 PM (Bangkok Time)**
- 🔍 **CONTENT IDEAS FILTERING, SORTING & PAGINATION**: Added comprehensive filtering and sorting system for Content Ideas with search by title/description, sort by date/title/priority/status, filter by status and priority, and reset filters functionality. Fixed pagination visibility to always show when more than 20 items exist. Enhanced two-column responsive layout with proper filtering integration. Improved user experience for managing large content collections with advanced filtering capabilities.

**October 18, 2025 - 4:40 PM (Bangkok Time)**

### 🚨 **Known Issues & Current Problems (October 10, 2025)**

#### **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX AFTER REBOOT:**
1. **Backend Server Won't Start**: Import path errors in management routes
   - Error: `Cannot find module '../middleware/auth'` 
   - Error: `Cannot find module '../../database/config'`
   - **Solution**: Fix import paths in `/backend/routes/management.js`

2. **Organization Dropdown Not Working**: 
   - Frontend shows "Select Organization" but dropdown is empty
   - Backend API `/api/auth/organizations` not responding
   - **Root Cause**: Backend server not running due to import errors

3. **Project Selection Blocked**:
   - Cannot select projects because organization selection fails
   - Shows "Select an organization first" message

#### **Non-Critical Issues:**
- **React Router warnings**: Future flag deprecations (non-breaking)
- **Console warnings**: React DevTools suggestion (non-breaking)
- **ESLint warning**: Missing dependency in Settings.tsx useEffect

   # Change: require('../../database/config') → require('../../database/config')
   ```

2. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd content-engine/backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify Organization API**:
