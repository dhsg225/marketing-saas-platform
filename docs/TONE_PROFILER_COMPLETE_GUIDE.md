# ðŸŽ¨ Advanced Tone & Style Profiler - Complete Guide

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED & WORKING  
**Component:** Feature 9 - Advanced Tone & Style Profiler  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What is the Tone & Style Profiler?

The Tone Profiler is a **brand voice template system** that automatically influences how AI generates content throughout your entire project. It's like setting the "personality" for all your AI-generated content - ensuring everything sounds like it's coming from the same "person" with consistent brand voice.

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works (Technical Overview)

### **1. Core Concept**
- **Tone Profiles** = Brand voice templates with detailed AI instructions
- **System Instructions** = The exact text sent to AI models as their "personality guide"
- **Project-Wide Influence** = These profiles automatically apply across all content generation

### **2. Database Structure**
```sql
-- tone_profiles table
tone_id UUID PRIMARY KEY
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL           -- "Australian Ocker Rough"
description TEXT                     -- Brief description
system_instruction TEXT NOT NULL    -- The magic AI personality text
owner_id UUID NOT NULL              -- Who created it
is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE     -- Share with organization
is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE      -- Enable/disable
usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0       -- Track usage
```

### **3. API Integration**
- **Frontend:** ToneProfiler.tsx component
- **Backend:** `/api/tone-profiles` routes
- **Database:** PostgreSQL tone_profiles table
- **AI Integration:** System instructions passed to AI models

AI Prompt: "Write a post about our new coffee blend"

### **Example 3: "Friendly & Conversational"**
