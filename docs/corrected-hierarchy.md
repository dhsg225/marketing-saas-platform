└── Projects (directly linked to organization)
```

├── Users (Your Team Members)
│   ├── Admin
│   ├── Content Creators
│   ├── Account Managers
│   └── Analysts
└── Clients (Your Customers)
    ├── Bangkok Bistro Group
    ├── Luxury Properties Thailand
    └── Digital Marketing Solutions
        └── Projects (Campaigns/Websites)
            ├── Social Media Campaign
            ├── Website Redesign
            └── SEO Optimization
```

- Users can work on multiple projects
- Clear role-based permissions

### 3. **Scalable Client Management**

## Migration Strategy

To fix the current implementation:

1. **Rename current "organizations" to "clients"**
2. **Create new "organizations" table for your agency**
3. **Update all relationships to use the correct hierarchy**
4. **Migrate existing data to the new structure**

This will give you a proper multi-tenant SaaS architecture where:
- You can manage multiple agencies (organizations)
- Each agency can have multiple clients
- Each client can have multiple projects
- Your team members can work across the entire system with proper permissions
