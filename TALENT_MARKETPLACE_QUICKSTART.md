**Status:** 🚀 Database Complete - Backend Development Starting  
**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Completion:** 4-6 weeks

## ✅ What's Been Done

### Database (COMPLETE ✅)
- **16 tables created** covering entire marketplace

- `talent_invoices` - Auto-generated invoices
- `talent_reviews` - Rating system

## 🎯 What We're Building

A complete marketplace where agencies book local creative talent with:

- ✅ Stripe Connect payments

- ✅ **10-15% platform commission**
- ✅ Auto-generated invoices
- ✅ 1099 tax forms

## 💰 Revenue Model

**Platform earns 10-15% on every booking:**
- Booking under $500 = 15% fee
- Booking $501-$2,000 = 12% fee
- Booking $2,001+ = 10% fee

**Example:**  
$1,000 booking = $120 platform fee + $850.70 to talent (after Stripe fees)
