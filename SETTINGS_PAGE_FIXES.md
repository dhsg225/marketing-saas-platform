# Settings Page Fixes - October 16, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Settings Link in Navigation
**Problem:** No navigation link to access the Settings page
**Solution:** Added "Settings" link to the "Manage" dropdown in the main navigation
**Location:** `content-engine/frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`
**URL:** `http://localhost:5002/settings`

### 2. ✅ Database Column Errors in Management API
**Problem:** Management API was failing with `column c.name does not exist` errors
**Root Cause:** The API was using incorrect column names for the clients table
**Solution:** Updated all queries to use correct column names:
- `c.name` → `c.company_name as name`
- `c.description` → `c.business_description as description`
- `c.contact_email` → `c.primary_contact_email as contact_email`
- `c.contact_phone` → `c.primary_contact_phone as contact_phone`

**Location:** `content-engine/backend/routes/management.js`

### 3. ✅ Data Access Filtering for User Ownership
**Problem:** Settings page was showing "No projects found" despite user having access to projects
**Root Cause:** Management API was not filtering data by user access permissions
**Solution:** Updated all queries to filter by user's organization access:
- Organizations: Only show organizations user belongs to
- Clients: Only show clients from user's organizations
- Projects: Only show projects from user's accessible clients
- Users: Only show users from same organizations

**Location:** `content-engine/backend/routes/management.js`
